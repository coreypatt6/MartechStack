## Verification

After pushing, verify the sync by:

2. Checking that all files are present
3. Reviewing the README.md for proper documentation
4. Ensuring the project description and details are correct

## Development Workflow

Once synced, use these commands for ongoing development:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

## Deployment Options

The project is ready for deployment on:

```bash
# Pull existing content first
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
